## Description
    This project was created so that users are able in input employee data so that it is tracked and display on a table. This table tracks the first and last name of an employee and the salary of said employee. The table is then sorted by the last name of each employee. Once the information is inputed, the average salary of all employees is calculated and displayed within the console. A random employee is also picked as a winner for a random drawing, also shown within the console.
